Subject: [PATCH 1/3] block, bfq: put async queues for root bfq groups too
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

For each pair [device for which bfq is selected as I/O scheduler,
group in blkio/io], bfq maintains a corresponding bfq group. Each such
bfq group contains a set of async queues, with each async queue
created on demand, i.e., when some I/O request arrives for it.  On
creation, an async queue gets an extra reference, to make sure that
the queue is not freed as long as its bfq group exists.  Accordingly,
to allow the queue to be freed after the group exited, this extra
reference must released on group exit.

The above holds also for a bfq root group, i.e., for the bfq group
corresponding to the root blkio/io root for a given device. Yet, by
mistake, the references to the existing async queues of a root group
are not released when the latter exits. This causes a memory leak when
the instance of bfq for a given device exits. In a similar vein,
bfqg_stats_xfer_dead is not executed for a root group.

This commit fixes bfq_pd_offline so that the latter executes the above
missing operations for a root group too.

Subject: [PATCH 2/3] block, bfq: release oom-queue ref to root group on exit

On scheduler init, a reference to the root group, and a reference to
its corresponding blkg are taken for the oom queue. Yet these
references are not released on scheduler exit, which prevents these
objects from be freed. This commit adds the missing reference
releases.

Subject: [PATCH 3/3] bfq-iosched: don't call bfqg_and_blkg_put for
 !CONFIG_BFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED

It's not available if we don't have group io scheduling set, and
there's no need to call it.
