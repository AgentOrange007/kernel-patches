From: Filippo Muzzini <filippo.muzzini@outlook.it>

Since bfq_finish_request() is always called on the request 'next',
after bfq_requests_merged() is finished, and bfq_finish_request()
removes 'next' from its bfq_queue if needed, it isn't necessary to do
such a removal in advance in bfq_merged_requests().

This commit removes such a useless 'next' removal.
