Subject: [PATCH 03/14] block, bfq: make sure queue budgets are not below
 service received

With some unlucky sequences of events, the function
bfq_updated_next_req updates the current budget of a bfq_queue to a
lower value than the service received by the queue using such a
budget. Unfortunately, if this happens, then the return value of the
function bfq_bfqq_budget_left becomes inconsistent.  This commit
solves this problem by lower-bounding the budget computed in
bfq_updated_next_req to the service currently charged to the queue.
