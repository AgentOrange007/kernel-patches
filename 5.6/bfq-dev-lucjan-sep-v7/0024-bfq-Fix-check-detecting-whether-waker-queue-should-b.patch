Subject: [PATCH 24/26] bfq: Fix check detecting whether waker queue should be
 selected

The check in bfq_select_queue() checking whether a waker queue should be
selected has a bug and is checking bfqq->next_rq instead of
bfqq->waker_bfqq->next_rq to verify whether the waker queue has a
request to dispatch. This often results in the condition being false
(most notably when the current queue is idling waiting for next request)
and thus the waker queue logic is ineffective. Fix the condition.
