Subject: [PATCH 5/6] block, bfq: push up injection only after setting service
 time

If equal to 0, the injection limit for a bfq_queue is pushed to 1
after a first sample of the total service time of the I/O requests of
the queue is computed (to allow injection to start). Yet, because of a
mistake in the branch that performs this action, the push may happen
also in some other case. This commit fixes this issue.
