Subject: [PATCH 1/6] block, bfq: update inject limit only after injection
 occurred

BFQ updates the injection limit of each bfq_queue as a function of how
much the limit inflates the service times experienced by the I/O
requests of the queue. So only service times affected by injection
must be taken into account. Unfortunately, in the current
implementation of this update scheme, the service time of an I/O
request rq not affected by injection may happen to be considered in
the following case: there is no I/O request in service when rq
arrives.

This commit fixes this issue by making sure that only service times
affected by injection are considered for updating the injection
limit. In particular, the service time of an I/O request rq is now
considered only if at least one of the following two conditions holds:
- the destination bfq_queue for rq underwent injection before rq
arrival, and there is still I/O in service in the drive on rq arrival
(the service of such unfinished I/O may delay the service of rq);
- injection occurs between the arrival and the completion time of rq.

Subject: [PATCH 2/6] block, bfq: reduce upper bound for inject limit to
 max_rq_in_driver+1

Upon an increment attempt of the injection limit, the latter is
constrained not to become higher than twice the maximum number
max_rq_in_driver of I/O requests that have happened to be in service
in the drive. This high bound allows the injection limit to grow
beyond max_rq_in_driver, which may then cause max_rq_in_driver itself
to grow.

However, since the limit is incremented by only one unit at a time,
there is no need for such a high bound, and just max_rq_in_driver+1 is
enough.

Subject: [PATCH 4/6] block, bfq: increase update frequency of inject limit

The update period of the injection limit has been tentatively set to
100 ms, to reduce fluctuations. This value however proved to cause,
occasionally, the limit to be decremented for some bfq_queue only
after the queue underwent excessive injection for a lot of time. This
commit reduces the period to 10 ms.

Subject: [PATCH 5/6] block, bfq: push up injection only after setting service
 time

If equal to 0, the injection limit for a bfq_queue is pushed to 1
after a first sample of the total service time of the I/O requests of
the queue is computed (to allow injection to start). Yet, because of a
mistake in the branch that performs this action, the push may happen
also in some other case. This commit fixes this issue.
