Subject: [PATCH 1/6] bfq: Fix check detecting whether waker queue should be
 selected

The check in bfq_select_queue() checking whether a waker queue should be
selected has a bug and is checking bfqq->next_rq instead of
bfqq->waker_bfqq->next_rq to verify whether the waker queue has a
request to dispatch. This often results in the condition being false
(most notably when the current queue is idling waiting for next request)
and thus the waker queue logic is ineffective. Fix the condition.

Subject: [PATCH 2/6] bfq: Allow short_ttime queues to have waker

Currently queues that have average think time shorter than slice_idle
cannot have waker. However this requirement is too strict. E.g. dbench
process always submits a one or two IOs (which is enough to pull its
average think time below slice_idle) and then blocks waiting for jbd2
thread to commit a transaction. Due to idling logic jbd2 thread is
often forced to wait for dbench's idle timer to trigger to be able to
submit its IO and this severely delays the overall benchmark progress.

E.g. on my test machine current dbench single-thread throughput is ~80
MB/s, with this patch it is ~200 MB/s.

Subject: [PATCH 3/6] bfq: Avoid false bfq queue merging

bfq_setup_cooperator() uses bfqd->in_serv_last_pos so detect whether it
makes sense to merge current bfq queue with the in-service queue.
However if the in-service queue is freshly scheduled and didn't dispatch
any requests yet, bfqd->in_serv_last_pos is stale and contains value
from the previously scheduled bfq queue which can thus result in a bogus
decision that the two queues should be merged. This bug can be observed
for example with the following fio jobfile:

[global]
direct=0
ioengine=sync
invalidate=1
size=1g
rw=read

[reader]
numjobs=4
directory=/mnt

where the 4 processes will end up in the one shared bfq queue although
they do IO to physically very distant files (for some reason I was able to
observe this only with slice_idle=1ms setting).

Fix the problem by invalidating bfqd->in_serv_last_pos when switching
in-service queue.

Subject: [PATCH 5/6] bfq: Use only idle IO periods for think time calculations

Currently whenever bfq queue has a request queued we add now -
last_completion_time to the think time statistics. This is however
misleading in case the process is able to submit several requests in
parallel because e.g. if the queue has request completed at time T0 and
then queues new requests at times T1, T2, then we will add T1-T0 and
T2-T0 to think time statistics which just doesn't make any sence (the
queue's think time is penalized by the queue being able to submit more
IO). So add to think time statistics only time intervals when the queue
had no IO pending.

Subject: [PATCH 6/6] block: bfq fix blkio cgroup leakage v2

commit db37a34c563b ("block, bfq: get a ref to a group when adding it to a service tree")
introduce leak forbfq_group and blkcg_gq objects because of get/put
imbalance. See trace balow:
-> blkg_alloc
   -> bfq_pq_alloc
     -> bfqg_get (+1)
->bfq_activate_bfqq
  ->bfq_activate_requeue_entity
    -> __bfq_activate_entity
       ->bfq_get_entity
         ->bfqg_and_blkg_get (+1)  <==== : Note1
->bfq_del_bfqq_busy
  ->bfq_deactivate_entity+0x53/0xc0 [bfq]
    ->__bfq_deactivate_entity+0x1b8/0x210 [bfq]
      -> bfq_forget_entity(is_in_service = true)
	 entity->on_st_or_in_serv = false   <=== :Note2
	 if (is_in_service)
	     return;  ==> do not touch reference
-> blkcg_css_offline
 -> blkcg_destroy_blkgs
  -> blkg_destroy
   -> bfq_pd_offline
    -> __bfq_deactivate_entity
         if (!entity->on_st_or_in_serv) /* true, because (Note2)
		return false;
 -> bfq_pd_free
    -> bfqg_put() (-1, byt bfqg->ref == 2) because of (Note2)
So bfq_group and blkcg_gq  will leak forever, see test-case below.

We should drop group reference once it finaly removed from service
inside __bfq_bfqd_reset_in_service, as we do with queue entities.

##TESTCASE_BEGIN:
#!/bin/bash

max_iters=${1:-100}
#prep cgroup mounts
mount -t tmpfs cgroup_root /sys/fs/cgroup
mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio
mount -t cgroup -o blkio none /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio

# Prepare blkdev
grep blkio /proc/cgroups
truncate -s 1M img
losetup /dev/loop0 img
echo bfq > /sys/block/loop0/queue/scheduler

grep blkio /proc/cgroups
for ((i=0;i<max_iters;i++))
do
    mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/a
    echo 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/a/cgroup.procs
    dd if=/dev/loop0 bs=4k count=1 of=/dev/null iflag=direct 2> /dev/null
    echo 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/cgroup.procs
    rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/a
    grep blkio /proc/cgroups
done
