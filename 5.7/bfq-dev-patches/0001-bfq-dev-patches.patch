Subject: [PATCH 1/3] bfq: Avoid false bfq queue merging

bfq_setup_cooperator() uses bfqd->in_serv_last_pos so detect whether it
makes sense to merge current bfq queue with the in-service queue.
However if the in-service queue is freshly scheduled and didn't dispatch
any requests yet, bfqd->in_serv_last_pos is stale and contains value
from the previously scheduled bfq queue which can thus result in a bogus
decision that the two queues should be merged. This bug can be observed
for example with the following fio jobfile:

[global]
direct=0
ioengine=sync
invalidate=1
size=1g
rw=read

[reader]
numjobs=4
directory=/mnt

where the 4 processes will end up in the one shared bfq queue although
they do IO to physically very distant files (for some reason I was able to
observe this only with slice_idle=1ms setting).

Fix the problem by invalidating bfqd->in_serv_last_pos when switching
in-service queue.

Subject: [PATCH 2/3] bfq: Use 'ttime' local variable

Use local variable 'ttime' instead of dereferencing bfqq.

Subject: [PATCH 3/3] bfq: Use only idle IO periods for think time calculations

Currently whenever bfq queue has a request queued we add now -
last_completion_time to the think time statistics. This is however
misleading in case the process is able to submit several requests in
parallel because e.g. if the queue has request completed at time T0 and
then queues new requests at times T1, T2, then we will add T1-T0 and
T2-T0 to think time statistics which just doesn't make any sence (the
queue's think time is penalized by the queue being able to submit more
IO). So add to think time statistics only time intervals when the queue
had no IO pending.
